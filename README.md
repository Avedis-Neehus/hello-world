test repo

I'm really intrested in about anything. I have however taken a special liking to philosophy and physics since in my opinion they ask the most fundamental questions. Out of curiosity and to teach myself some Python I started writing some physics simulations, some of which you may see uploaded here.

As you might have noticed, I'm not a native English speaker. I was born in Germany and am partly german, argentinian and armenian.

I'm looking forward to be working with you.
